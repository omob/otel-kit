# Changelog

## 0.1.1

Added

- `traces.otlp.headers`, `metrics.otlp.headers` and `logs.otlp.headers` accept an async factory as well as a plain object. Backends whose credentials expire — Google Cloud's OTLP endpoint refreshes its OAuth2 token hourly — cannot be reached with a static header map.

Documentation

- Install instructions say which Google package each route needs. Both were listed together, implying you needed both for traces alone, and the OTLP route needs neither.
- The quick start starts on the console exporter, which needs nothing running. It pointed at `http://localhost:4318` before, where most people have nothing listening — and a refused export is silent, so the first experience of the package was an empty backend.
- A recipe for Google Cloud over OTLP, which is where Google is moving everyone: `@google-cloud/opentelemetry-cloud-trace-exporter` is deprecated and will be archived after 30 October 2026.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `Telemetry.start` / `Telemetry.shutdown` with pluggable trace, metric and log exporters: OTLP over protobuf, JSON or gRPC, Google Cloud, Prometheus and console.
- `withSpan` handles `recordException`, span status and `end` on every path, with `isError` to keep expected failures out of your error rate.
- Ratio sampling or your own sampler, configurable propagators for W3C, B3 and Jaeger, per-instrumentation enable, disable and options.
- Buffered spans flush on SIGTERM and SIGINT, then the signal is handed back so the host's own shutdown runs.
- A rejected configuration disables telemetry and reports through `onStartupError` rather than stopping the host from booting.
- Prometheus binds loopback, span attributes are capped, and non-finite attribute values are dropped before export.
